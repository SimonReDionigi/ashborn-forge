# ashborn-forge

**Ashborn Forge** is the experimental repository of the Ashborn test bench, developed as part of the Phoenix Volt project.

## Purpose

The test bench is designed to validate and prototype three key functional blocks:

- üîã **Discharge circuit**  
- ‚ö° **Charge circuit**  
- üå°Ô∏è **Thermal management system**

These components will work together to enable accurate measurement and evaluation of the **State of Health (SOH)** of second-life battery cells.

## Tools and Platform

The hardware logic is developed primarily using **Arduino-compatible microcontrollers**, sensors, and power electronics.

## Contributors

This project is maintained by the Phoenix Volt technical team:  
Simone, Riccardo, and Antonio.
